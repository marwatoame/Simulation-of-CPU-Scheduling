# Simulation-of-CPU-Scheduling

This project is to simulate the process of loading a new process and adding it to the ready queue, short term scheduler, and the IO waiting queue in a multi-processor system.

Different scheduling algorithms are used such as Round-robin (RR) , shortest remaining time first (SRTF) and First Come First Served (FCFS).

The output for each simulation contains the CPU utilization, average response time and throughput value.
